2. Telegram Bot – Product & Service Posting (similar to Educational Posts)
Currently, educational post handling is implemented. Services and products need to follow the same structure:

A media group (images/videos) is sent to the user.

The description is included as a caption.

If the description is too long, a link to the full text on telegra.ph should be automatically created and attached instead.

You must also ensure good error and exception handling for these operations.

Extra Bot Features:
For both products and services, below the sent media group, include an inline button labeled “Request Price”.

When clicked, it registers a price inquiry in the database.

The price_inquiry table includes either a product_id or a service_id:

If a product inquiry: product_id is filled, service_id remains null.

If a service inquiry: service_id is filled, product_id remains null.

This logic is already partly implemented — please verify and finalize.

3. Inline Category Keyboards
In bot category listings (for services, products, or educational posts), show the number of items or subcategories inside parentheses next to each title. For example:

If a category has 3 products: Cables (3)

If a parent category has 2 subcategories: Electronics (2)

4. Bot Search Functionality
In the search section of the bot:

Prompt the user for a keyword.

Search all products, services, and educational posts for the keyword in any field (e.g., title, description).

Send matching entries one by one to the user, using the same structure (media group + caption or telegra.ph link).

Final Deliverables:

Run all relevant tests to ensure:

Media upload, deletion, and linking work correctly.

Products/services/educational items display media thumbnails correctly in the panel list view.

List page state is preserved when navigating to/from create/edit forms.

All Telegram bot features behave as described, with proper exception handling.

Category counters, search, and inline buttons function as intended.
